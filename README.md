# win32-jam-autumn-2024

Entry for the [Autumn 2024 Win32 Jam](https://itch.io/jam/win32-jam-autumn-2024)

## Details

BiSectEd makes use of SDL 1.2 and OpenGL 1.1 to maintain compatibility with
Open Watcom 1.9 and Windows 95. It also builds for modern systems with gcc and
[sdl12-compat](https://github.com/libsdl-org/sdl12-compat).

A vendored copy of SDL 1.2 (slightly modified) is provided for use by Watcom
builds.
